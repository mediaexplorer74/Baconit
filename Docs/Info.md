Login Crashes

Baconit has been my go-to Reddit app on Windows 10 for years, but now it crashes whenever I try to log in. :(

Popups begging to give a review

I like the fact that the program works. I really don't like (detest, actually) that a popup appears asking me to leave a review, and there's no way of clicking to make it go away, unless I click the "Leave a review" button. This is definitely not a good user experience, and reeks of desperation.

I'm glad it's here
this is still my reddit app of choice, but I had to drop the review as it freezes and crashes, and now won't even start on RS2.
